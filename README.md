## Hi! Welcome to my GitHub profile page.

I'm Colin, a high school student who works on random projects that come to mind, among other things.

Some stuff I'm working on:

- [CubeDAW](https://github.com/Creative0708/cubedaw), a WIP digital audio workstation
- [Micropixel](https://github.com/Creative0708/micropixel), a minimalist game engine

There are more that are private, and I hope to work on them soon. Eventually...


### Contacts
For most purposes, my email is good enough: [therealcreative0708@gmail.com](mailto:therealcreative0708@gmail.com)<br>
I don't have many other social media apps that I'm active on. More to come in the future, I guess
